# Prime Number Calculator Project

This project implements a prime number calculator in both C++ and Python, leveraging advanced optimization techniques and parallelization to compute the first 1,000,000 prime numbers. The goal is to compare the performance and efficiency of both implementations when executed in a Linux environment.

## Overview

### Objectives

1. Implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm in C++ and Python.
2. Optimize both implementations for maximum performance.
3. Utilize parallelization techniques to handle large computations efficiently.
4. Compare the performance of both implementations in a Linux environment.

## Implementations

### C++ Implementation

#### Compilation

To compile the C++ implementation with optimization and parallelization support, execute the following command:

```sh
g++ -O3 -fopenmp -o prime_calculator prime_calculator.cpp
```

#### Execution

Run the compiled program:

```sh
./prime_calculator
```

### Python Implementation

#### Dependencies

Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:

```sh
pip install numpy
```

#### Execution

Run the Python program:

```sh
python prime_calculator.py
```

## Performance Comparison

### Execution Time

- **C++ Version**: 1m34.083s
- **Python Version**: 0m0.809s

### Analysis

1. **Python Efficiency**:
   - Despite common beliefs, Python outperformed C++ in this scenario due to the use of highly optimized libraries (`numpy`) and effective parallelization (`multiprocessing`).
   - `numpy` provides efficient numerical operations that are difficult to match with manual implementations in C++.

2. **Compiler Optimization**:
   - The C++ code was compiled with `-O3` optimization and parallelized with OpenMP. However, the performance did not match the Python version, indicating that further optimizations or different parallelization techniques might be needed.

3. **Algorithm Implementation**:
   - Both implementations used the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. Minor differences in how the algorithm was implemented and the efficiency of underlying libraries contributed to the performance difference.

## Conclusion

### Key Takeaways

1. **High-Level Libraries**:
   - High-level libraries like `numpy` can provide significant performance benefits for numerical computations, sometimes surpassing well-optimized compiled code.
   
2. **Parallelization**:
   - Effective parallelization is crucial for performance. Python's `multiprocessing` can be highly efficient, and similar techniques should be carefully implemented in C++.

3. **Algorithm Optimization**:
   - Always consider the efficiency of the algorithm implementation. Even slight differences in how the algorithm is executed can have a major impact on performance.

### Lessons Learned

- Optimization requires a deep understanding of both the algorithm and the tools available in the chosen programming language.
- High-level abstractions and libraries can significantly reduce development time and improve performance.
- Profiling and benchmarking are essential to identify performance bottlenecks and validate improvements.

## Future Work

1. **Further Optimization**:
   - Investigate further optimizations in C++ and explore other parallelization libraries or techniques.

2. **Algorithm Variants**:
   - Test different algorithms for prime number generation to compare their performance.

3. **Cross-Language Learning**:
   - Use insights from the highly optimized `numpy` implementation to improve C++ code.
